# Analysis of the aircraft that have lower risk

### Project Question
Your company is expanding in to new industries to diversify its portfolio. Specifically, they are interested in purchasing and operating airplanes for commercial and private enterprises, but do not know anything about the potential risks of aircraft. You are charged with determining which aircraft are the lowest risk for the company to start this new business endeavor. You must then translate your findings into actionable insights that the head of the new aviation division can use to help decide which aircraft to purchase.

### Overview
An analysis of the data provided by the National Transportation Safety Board that includes aviation accident data from 1962 to 2023 about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents in the United States and international waters has been done and given outputs such that we were able to establish the fatalities linked to certain aircraft and therefore we were able to determine the best aircraft for the company to expand their portfolio with.

A link to the Tableau page where we see the relation between the phase of the flight and the fatalities at that stage: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/yvonne.julio/viz/Phase1_17458665933190/Sheet1?publish=yes
